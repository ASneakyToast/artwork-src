### Intelligent rocks?
After spending so much time thinking about how machines and complex system might possibly be intilligent or alive, I've started to think the same about rocks.
While rocks themselves might not give any indicitation that they are alive, I could start to imanige a system in which the rocks play a part.
The whole geology system could be seen as a planet-wide system, enacting it's physical presence on the world.

### Upgraded Rocks
An individual rock itself does have a system it's "body" follows.
It will errode, crack, and move around for most if not all of it's life.
I'm interesed in the properties of rocks that we might not yet beaware of.
Specifically how rocks interact and are affected by technology.
With Arthur I'm wondering if conductive materials, such as wires, make pathways for internal stress to be affected by?
