In my work, I leverage print techniques for ‘painting.’ Whether I use e-waste as a model for digital translation or a basis for sculpture, machines and technology are intuitive to the process. A recent series of transmissions materializes as custom laser cut rubber stamps originating from parts of disused printers and other found machines. The stamps were then ghost-printed on gessoed plywood with an optical film reused from a discarded TV suspended in front of it. As opposed to my more formulaic approach to printmaking, my paper-making processes have a more emergent, ritual-like tone. Much of my materials are sourced from my own recycled paper waste– blended up and given an alternate life.
