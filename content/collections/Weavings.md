I weave political art about Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
A travesty only visible to me through pictures on the internet.
I remake these in textiles to lean into the warm and comforting feeling usually associated with textiles.
Emphasizing the dissonance that these foreboding images have and create.
A convoy of Russian tanks become alike little ants from an airplane.
The physical showdown of Putian and Macron become two ghostly shadows, facing eachother at oppsides sides of a room.

These weavings could be considered printmedia.
The weaft structures are automatically assigned by a digital loom, the TC2.
The finish consists of pulling it off the loom and framing it.
The imagery is photographic and tranmitted through the process.
