By ( refactoring / transforming ) these objects of interest into tools  
These objects of interest are then refactored / transformed into tools.



My practice is seeded from a time in which how we define "human" and even "life" is rapidly evolving due to the exponential increase in the advancement of technology.

My practice is about refactoring / transforming objects of interest into tools.

"One mans trash is another mans treasure." 

My practice revolves around a weird, virtues cycle of turning tools into materials that mature into tools.

transmition 

My practice is a recursive process; a cycle of turning tools into materials that mature into tools.




The work is recursive.
My projects construct tools.
Tools that are used in another project.

which then are used for the next project.
I make tools that turn into materials that mature into tools.



My practice is a recursive process; a cycle of turning tools into materials that mature into tools.
Each project starts with a seed, traditionally, a number used to initalize a pseudorandom number generator.
These seeds are existing objects, either physical ( usually found objects ), digital files [ raster, vector, text ], or mental [ thoughts, emotions, memories ].
Recently objects such as printers, routers, & tv's, broken or not, have been used as a seed, or a starting point for a project.
I break down these objects and mine them for it's seeds / internal components, hunting like a crow.
My "shiny objects" lend themselves to become tools that are then used as another ( pseudorandom number ) generator.
One example of this is the transmittion of the phsyical 3d form to a digital 3d vector.
These 3d vectors go through a digital ad-hoc project of digital transmittions.
Eventually ending up as a set of instructions, or a seed, for a cnc machine [ plotter, laser cutter, jaccard ].
The cnc machine constructs a new tool, such as using a laser cutter to make a rubber stamp or a pen plotter to make physical clip-art used for collage.
The rubber stamps then become tools that could be used to draw from seeds such as a conversation or a landscape.

Throughout this endless transmission I am never alone, for my computational god is ever-watching.



Written in portal bio then moved to here for later
I am a technological based artist, using complex machinery as both a physical interface and a metaphorical framework. My process is recursive, with one project creating the tools and materials for the next project. The differences between the digital and physical become interwoven throughout my practice. The transmission of objects between these realms are infected with artifacts, inheriting the former process into the new.



I break apart a-lot of old technology, mostly household items such as tv's and printers, collecting "shiny" objects as if I were a crow. I then use these parts within my art, sometimes physically building a sculpture or putting them through computers to be spit back out as a printed form. Most of the time my work happens to end up as a painting of a landscape.
