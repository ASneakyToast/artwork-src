### Panel Num.3
This is the third panel of a triptic called "Convergence".
This panel is set on an extreme side of a spectrum illustrated throughout the tripic.
Set on the right side, this boundry represents complete replication of the Earth's natural world.

### Replicating Nature
I sometimes wonder why I and other artists set out to replicate nature.
Maybe it's to detail and understand the sublime, hoping to use and evoke that same feeling within our own creations.

I find the replication of nature through programming to be a most interesting form of ode.
To be unbound by the physical forces of nature, only to recreate a sub-optimal simulation.
