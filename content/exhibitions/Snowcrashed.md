"Snowcrashed" is a term I have self-diagnosed myself with.
A play on the overwhelming idea of how much technology has influenced my life today. 
An idea that is sometimes to hard to grasp and put's itself just out of my reach of comprehension.
Such as an overly detailed map.
There are moments when this idea turns into a feeling, physically hurting.
Like eye strain from looking at a screen for too long.
And times when there is this weird mental dissonance.
Like finding oblivion in news articles on your phone.

This work is a reproduction of this feeling.
Representing moments in my life where I was snowcrashing.
Created with materials that instill it's prescribed effect into the viewer.
Films from old TV's that cause your eye to rapidly cascade.
The abstraction and warmth textiles creates on a foreboding image.
The physical layering of large bitmaps causing incomprehension.
