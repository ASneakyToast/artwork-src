### The Setup
This piece was a result of my [Screen Painting](/artwork/collections/Screen%20Paintings) concept.
I took 3 of the 4 cymk separations from the previous project, The Cube, and pulled them as a single blue background layer.

### JoJo, the Figure
I've had this idea of a figure with tall legs and looking cramped in a boxy room, but I've never been able to conjure an acceptable illustration.
However, once the background was laid down, I knew I wanted this figure within it.
I sat down with a good friend of mine, Joseph Blake, and collaborated on this figure.

### An Oculus, infected
The eye-machine like figure in this print has been used in many of my other past projects, representing many different things figure in this print has been used in many of my other past projects.
It's symbolic representation changes with every piece, but is mainly used to represent my own "looking" within a digital world.
In this print specifically, it is depicted as infected and entangled with miscalculations.

### Analysis of a Cube
The oculus is seen being used on some cube-like objects on the right side of the print.
These cubes were the focus of the project the original layers were created for.
However this project had some technical issues and I ended up obsessing over my failure.
