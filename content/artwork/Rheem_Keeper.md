### It's Alive!
I often pick up old machinery and see individuality within the object, a character of sorts.
While playing around with an old piolet lighter I placed a glass eye I previously made into one of it's slot and volia, the object was alive.

### A Fishtank 
There's alot of creatures you can "keep" in a fishtank, so why not this one?
I chose to display this piece within it's tank because it further drives home the point that this thing is alive, and even intently observable.

### It's Enviroment
With the main initial item being a mechanical object that creates a spark, I thought it was ironic that I felt like the creature's natural enviroment was a dry field.
The way I envisioned this ecology working revolved around the creature sucking moisture through it's tendrials, preserving it inside itself.
Keeping a hostilely dry enviroment is also a defense mechanism, making it hard for other creatures to get close and so there's fuel incase it has to fight.
