### Once in a show
I've rigged this piece up with an Arduino so that at a random point during the show it dribbles a liquid out of the red balloon.
During the Interface show I clamped the piece on a small easal with a piece of paper neath the balloon.

### Why and How?
"What can you do with a balloon embeded in paper?" was the question that created this project.
Joseph Blake was experimenting with adding balloons in paper and approached me with a sheet.
After throwing some silly ideas around we decided on the idea that it would dribble a liquid.
I decided to start prototyping a water dispenser that could be hidden behind the paper, using an arduino with a servo motor I could set a random timer to tip a tube over.
With Joseph making the materials and myself prototyping the mechanics I asked Anise Aiello if she wanted to compose the paper on the canvas.
A day later she's cut it up into a million pieces and created what the viewer sees today.

### The pink balloon
Yes somebody stole it!
During the 2021 Fall Craft Fair at CCA's Oakland campus I decided to hang it in the mens bathroom.
Joseph and I have talked about displaying art publicly on campus in non-traditional spaces and this was the perfect storm of an artwork, location, and event.
At some point inbetween this event and the fall Interface show somebody had removed and taken the pink balloon from one of the center pieces.

We all liked the idea that somebody has a stolen pink balloon in their pocket.
