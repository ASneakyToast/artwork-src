### I am a Cyborg
I may not ( yet ) have any circuit boards embeded within my body, but I would still consider myself a cyborg.
After 22 years of living and 3 years of art school I can confidently say I have technology within me.
Years of interfacing with various devices has permently infected my brain and body.
I commonly rely upon machines to interact with the physical world, such as a plotter or laser cutter.
I think programaticly and organize many of my projects around the procedure.

For this project I procedurally laser cut different shapes on each print in this edition of 7.
These cut-outs expose a digital screen that animates a neon green grid.
