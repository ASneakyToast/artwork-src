My practice is a recursive process; a cycle of turning tools into materials that mature into tools.
Each project starts with a seed, traditionally, a number used to initalize a pseudorandom number generator.
These seeds are existing objects, either physical ( usually found objects ), digital files [ raster, vector, text ], or mental [ thoughts, emotions, memories ].
Recently objects such as printers, routers, & tv's, broken or not, have been used as a seed, or a starting point for a project.
I break down these objects and mine them for it's seeds / internal components, hunting like a crow.
My "shiny objects" lend themselves to become tools that are then used as another ( pseudorandom number ) generator.
One example of this is the transmittion of the phsyical 3d form to a digital 3d vector.
These 3d vectors go through a digital ad-hoc project of digital transmittions.
Eventually ending up as a set of instructions, or a seed, for a cnc machine [ plotter, laser cutter, jaccard ].
The cnc machine constructs a new tool, such as using a laser cutter to make a rubber stamp or a pen plotter to make physical clip-art used for collage.
The rubber stamps then become tools that could be used to draw from seeds such as a conversation or a landscape.
