I work with a method of painting that relies on print techniques.
My work often goes through a series of exploratory transmutations between digital and physical states.
Whether I'm using old e-waste as a form for sculpture or model for a digital translation, machines and technology always find their way into the process.
My most recent series of transmissions has materialized as custom laser cut stamps that originated from parts of e-waste.
These stamps were then ghost printed on white plywood with an optical film reused from an old TV suspended in front of it.
