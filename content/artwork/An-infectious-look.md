### The Setup
This piece was a result of my [Screen Painting](/artwork/collections/screen-painting) concept.
I took 3 of the 4 cymk seperations from the previous project, [Joel Lithgow's The Cube](/artwork/Joel-lithgows-the-cube) and pulled them as a single blue background layer.

### JoJo, the Figure
I've had this idea of a figure with tall legs and cramped in a boxy room, but I've never been able to conjure an acceptable illustration.
However, once the background was layed down, I knew I wanted this figure within it.
I sat down with a good friend of mine, Joseph Blake
