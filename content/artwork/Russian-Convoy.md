I've been following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia pretty frequently and mainly through news articles on my phone.
One set of images that I constantly come across are of Russian convoys; which are "satellite images of military operations used to securely move personnel and cargo by ground transportation."
These images are ( or have the potential to be ) extremely foreboding, usually depicting massive lines of large military vehicles intended to cause mass destruction.
However the way in which I view these images, though my phone, safe within my own home, on a news site, captured from an out of reach satellite, creates this crazy amount of dissonance.
It's hard to look at these images for a variety of reasons.
