### The Scariest Word
I recently came to the conclusion that the scariest word I know is "Permafried". 

__Permafried__ - A permanent mental state caused by an overconsumption of drugs.

Although I would not associate myself with this word I have seen it within other people and seem to grok it enough to understand the irreverable effect it has.
This irrversable effect is what scares me the most.
The fact that my mental state, the epicenter of my rational and concious thought, could be altered to a point where I am no longer in control is what scares me.

The sliver-lining I place on those I imigiange as affected is that this mental state could become benevolent and construct a blissful experience of it all.
And although that sounds nice, it makes me feel as if it's already kicking in.

### The Eliskni Children
These four armed, joyful, children-like creatures are blissfully playing in a field. 
While they may not be the same Eliskni from the Destiny Universe, these creatures are influenced by the their design.
I say this not because they both have four arms, but because of the developmental cycle of the Eliskni race and their dependence on a substance called Ether.
Ether is an all-in-one substance for the Eliskini that supplies food, nuiterietes, hormones, pheromones, dopamine, etc.

### The Machine
Within the Destiny world Ether is given out to the Eliskni though giant floating machines called Servitors.
These Servitors distribute Ether at the will of the group Kell, or captian, but sometimes they take the control when the Kell is absent.
This servitor looks as if it has been experimenting with the effects of overindulging on young Eliskni.
