### The Process
This project was created while exploring print techniques with a vaccumformer.
By using a silkscreen I could print giant, flat, blocking shapes on a piece of plastic used with the vaccumformer.
These shapes could then be heated and molded onto something, masking the color and only revealing for form. 

### The intricacies of a circuit board 
I've always been drawn to the intricate layout of a circuit board.
There's something I enjoy about the idea of being able to optimize a composition.
The result of such systematic procedure emerges as something beyond it's physical connections.
