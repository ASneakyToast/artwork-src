### Process Exploration
This project was created while exploring print techniques with a vaccumformer.
By using a silkscreen I could print giant, flat, blocking shapes on a piece of plastic used with the vaccumformer.
These shapes could then be heated and molded onto something, masking the color and only revealing for form. 
For this exploration I vaccumformed printed blocking shapes onto circuit boards
