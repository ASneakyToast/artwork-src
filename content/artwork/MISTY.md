### Molecular Information Storage
Molecular Information Storage, or MIST, is the method of using biological DNA for data storage.

The idea that we can store data within biological samples blows me away.
Not only is it crazy that we can physically do it in the first place, but that it's also "more efficient" than anything we have today.

The biggest implicaton that I'm interested in is within the errors that WILL occur.
The thought that it will be possible for your body to mistakenly interact with data placed inside of it is.
A computer virus that could take out your arm, or record the sensory input from your eye.
