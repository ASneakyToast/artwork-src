### VR as a communication tool
I'm interested in how we as a species can use VR as a communication tool for computational life.
While english may be the best way for me to verbalize something I would iminage this not to be true for a computer.
While a computer can use words, I think the most gramatik way for a machine to speak would be to create it's own simulation.
