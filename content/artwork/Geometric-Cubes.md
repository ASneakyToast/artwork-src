### A Strategic Print
Total creativity... no themes, topics, or clients.
That's what I was given during my first screen printing class.
This creative freedom didn't make it easier to decide my project, if anything it made it harder.
To help with this I thought about what attributes screenprinting lends itself to.
The most obvious is being able to print multiples of something.
However the thought of having an edition of identical prints does not appeal to me.
I thought I could get the best of both worlds by creating procedure that would generate a unique image based on the amount each layer is used.

### The Algorithm
By creating three isometric shapes I am able to arrange them in a variety of ways.
Some pieces are created with all sides using the same stencil, while others are a combination of the three.
Using this procedure I created an edition of 27 different prints.
